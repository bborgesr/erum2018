## Drilldown data discovery with Shiny
_Barbara Borges Ribeiro_

Data science is often thought as carefully _building up_ from data. However there are many cases where going the other away around, and _drilling down_ into the data, can also be extremely useful. Have you ever seen a plot where something seems off? Maybe it's a few egregious outliers or a quirk in the expected trend. Instead of going back to the drawing board immediately, you can leverage the power of Shiny to allow you to interactively start from an aggregate visualization (or summary) and then drill down into the lower-level, finer-grained data. Whether it is by interactively creating new tabs, modal windows or other methods, _drilling down_ allows you to discover data that's been right under your nose, without having to leave your Shiny app. In addition to _drilling down_, you can also _drill through_ (by looking at snapshots of the data at different periods), and even _drill up_ (by creating aggregate values from the underlying data). These capabilities allow for more satisfying data presentation or data reporting Shiny apps, since its consumers can investigate the data to their heart's content. In this talk, I will demo a mock personal finance Shiny app that takes advantage of functions like `insertUI`/`removeUI`, `appendTab`/`removeTab`, and `showModal`/`removeModal`.
