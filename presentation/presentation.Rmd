# Overview 

**PART I**

In the context of data, what is:

  - drilling down? drilling through? drilling up?
  - _Plan_: "show, don't tell": demo illustrative Shiny app

**PART II**

Let's talk about abstractions

  - _Plan_: diagrams!

# Demo time

- All of our "drillings" (down/through/up) will be demoed in this app
- All of our "drillings" are also implemented through dynamic UI

**Relevant functions**:

  - `appendTab` and `removeTab`
  - `showModal` and `removeModal`
  - `insertUI` and `removeUI`.
